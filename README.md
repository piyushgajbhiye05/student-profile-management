# student-profile-management

This project is a student profile management application.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information on deployment, check the section about deployment.

#### `npm run eject`

Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control over them. After ejecting, all commands except eject will work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them as needed.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature unless you need customization.
